## 🧩 Technology Stack

This project integrates multiple technologies to simulate a real-world full-stack application.  
Each component of the stack plays a specific role in achieving scalability, performance, and maintainability.

### Backend Framework

**Django** — A high-level Python web framework used to build robust and scalable backend systems.  
It provides tools for handling authentication, ORM (Object Relational Mapping), and RESTful APIs efficiently.

### Database

**MySQL** — A relational database management system used to store and manage structured data such as users, bookings, and listings.

### API Query Language

**GraphQL** — Enables flexible and efficient data retrieval for clients by allowing them to specify exactly what data they need.

### Containerization

**Docker** — Used to package the application into containers for consistent deployment across different environments.

### Version Control

**Git & GitHub** — Used for source code management, collaboration, and version control throughout the project lifecycle.

### Continuous Integration / Deployment (CI/CD)

**GitHub Actions** — Automates testing, builds, and deployment workflows, ensuring efficient and reliable development pipelines.

### Security & Authentication

**JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** — Implements secure user authentication and API access control.

### Frontend (Optional for Full Stack Integration)

**React.js** — A JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces that consume data from the backend API.
