# Airbnb Clone Project

## Project Overview

The Airbnb Clone Project is a backend-focused, real-world application designed to simulate a booking platform similar to Airbnb.  
The project provides hands-on experience with backend systems, database design, API development, security practices, and modern software development workflows.

## Project Goals

- Implement secure user registration, authentication, and profile management.
- Build property management functionality for hosts.
- Enable users to make and manage bookings.
- Process payments securely and efficiently.
- Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
- Optimize database performance and caching for scalability.
- Set up automated testing and deployment pipelines to maintain high-quality code.

## Technology Stack

The project uses a combination of backend, database, and infrastructure technologies to achieve a robust and scalable application.

### Backend Framework

**Django** — A high-level Python web framework used to implement the backend logic, handle routing, authentication, and ORM for database interactions.

**Django REST Framework** — Extends Django to create RESTful APIs, simplifying CRUD operations for users, properties, bookings, payments, and reviews.

### Database

**PostgreSQL** — A relational database used to store structured data such as users, properties, bookings, payments, and reviews with integrity and reliability.

### API Query Language

**GraphQL** — Provides flexible and efficient querying, allowing clients to retrieve only the data they need, reducing bandwidth usage and improving performance.

### Task Queue

**Celery** — Handles asynchronous tasks, such as sending notifications and processing payments, to improve application responsiveness.

### Cache and Session Management

**Redis** — Serves as a cache to speed up frequent database queries and manages session data for logged-in users.

### Containerization

**Docker** — Ensures consistent development and deployment environments across different systems, simplifying setup and scaling.

### Version Control

**Git & GitHub** — Facilitates source code management, team collaboration, and version tracking.

### CI/CD Pipelines

**GitHub Actions** — Automates testing, builds, and deployment, ensuring faster and more reliable development cycles.

## Team Roles

### Backend Developer

Responsible for implementing API endpoints, integrating business logic, and ensuring scalable and maintainable code.

### Database Administrator

Designs and maintains the relational database structure, optimizes queries, and ensures data integrity.

### DevOps Engineer

Manages deployment, CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and monitors system performance.

### QA Engineer

Develops and executes test cases, performs integration and regression testing, and ensures high-quality software delivery.

### Project Manager

Oversees project progress, coordinates teams, and ensures tasks align with deadlines and goals.

### UI/UX Designer

Designs user-friendly interfaces and collaborates with backend developers to ensure API functionality aligns with user flows.

### Business Analyst

Analyzes project requirements, translates them into technical specifications, and monitors project performance.

---

## Database Design

The database structure uses relational principles to maintain consistency and efficiency.

### User

Represents guests and hosts.

- id (unique identifier)
- username
- email
- password
- role (guest or host)
  **Relationships:** Can own multiple properties and make multiple bookings.

### Property

Represents a listing created by a host.

- id
- owner_id (foreign key to User)
- title
- description
- price_per_night
  **Relationships:** Belongs to one User; can have multiple bookings and reviews.

### Booking

Represents a reservation made by a user for a property.

- id
- user_id (foreign key to User)
- property_id (foreign key to Property)
- check_in_date
- check_out_date
- status (pending, confirmed, cancelled)
  **Relationships:** Belongs to one User and one Property; may have one Payment.

### Payment

Handles financial transactions related to bookings.

- id
- booking_id (foreign key to Booking)
- amount
- payment_method
- status (successful, failed, refunded)
  **Relationships:** Belongs to one Booking.

### Review

Captures feedback and ratings from users after a stay.

- id
- user_id (foreign key to User)
- property_id (foreign key to Property)
- rating (1–5)
- comment
  **Relationships:** Belongs to one User and one Property.

## Feature Breakdown

### User Management

Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management. Enables users to create accounts, securely log in, and manage personal information.

### Property Management

Allows hosts to create, update, and delete property listings, ensuring accurate availability and pricing information.

### Booking System

Manages reservations, tracks check-in and check-out dates, and ensures property availability is correctly updated.

### Payment Processing

Handles all transactions related to bookings, maintaining security and reliability in financial operations.

### Review System

Allows users to post ratings and comments for properties, helping build trust and guide future guests.

## API Security

Securing the backend APIs is critical to protect user data, financial transactions, and system integrity.

- **Authentication (JWT):** Ensures only authorized users can access API endpoints.
- **Authorization:** Controls which actions each user can perform, preventing unauthorized modifications.
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevents abuse by limiting excessive requests, reducing the risk of denial-of-service attacks.
- **Data Validation & Encryption:** Protects sensitive information, including passwords and payment details, from exposure.

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines automate the process of testing, building, and deploying code.  
They ensure faster deployment, detect errors early through automated testing, and maintain consistent builds across environments.

### Tools and Technologies

- **GitHub Actions:** Automates workflows including testing, building, and deployment.
- **Docker:** Provides consistent containerized environments for development and deployment.
- **Celery & Redis:** Supports asynchronous task handling as part of automated pipelines.
